# Testing
During the development we used Postman for testing our endpoints. Postman testing file, and output screens can be found [HERE](https://github.com/gedand/452c8c82-Virucid/tree/main/backend/docs/postman). There, we show every endpoints functionallly working, and we also show different kind of error messages for different inputs.

Also, we used PEP8 pylint to ensure our code is in correct readable format.
